with the bug fixes and developments in the updated Python code,
the submission should now be able to properly identify and click on buttons on the web page. 
The deviations made to the on_submit_clicked function guarantee that the correct buttons are recognized and clicked based on the available choices and the analyzed text. 
The enhanced logic for handling buttons and selecting the correct option for dropdowns should allow the submission to interact with forms more efficiently.
Please run the restructured Python code, and when you provide a URL and open a web page that comprises forms with buttons, 
it should be able to cooperate with the buttons and fill out the form fields accordingly.
